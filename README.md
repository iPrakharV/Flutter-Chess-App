## AI Description

The chess AI we developed for this app uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to calculate which moves to make. There are six difficulty levels in the app, each level corresponding to the depth of the search used in the minimax algorithm. The highest difficulty is 6, which corresponds to 3 full chess moves.
